# Data Science Project: British Airways Customer Reviews and Booking Predictive Modeling
## Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a data science project conducted in collaboration with British Airways. The primary objective of this project was to leverage data science techniques to analyze customer booking behavior and develop a predictive model to understand factors influencing ticket purchases.

## Project Highlights:
- Scraped and analyzed customer review data from Skytrax.
- Conducted Natural Language Processing (NLP) and word cloud analysis to derive insights from customer reviews seen below.
- Built a predictive model using machine learning algorithms to forecast customer booking behavior.
- Identified biases in the data, particularly with over 85% of instances indicating completed booking processes.
- Developed a Random Forest Model with a recall of 65% and an accuracy of 67% for predicting customer ticket purchases.
